# Issue #23: Admin Page Responsive Design Improvement

## Goal

Improve the responsive design of admin.html to ensure proper display and usability on mobile devices and smaller screens.

## ToDo

- Add CSS media queries for mobile breakpoints (e.g., max-width: 768px, 480px)
- Adjust sidebar layout for mobile: collapsible or stacked
- Optimize form elements and buttons for touch interfaces
- Test layout on various screen sizes
- Update styles/admin.css with responsive rules

## Acceptance Criteria

- Admin page displays correctly on mobile devices without horizontal scrolling
- Sidebar is usable on small screens (e.g., hamburger menu if needed)
- All interactive elements are touch-friendly
- No layout breaks or overlapping elements

## Risk Assessment

Tier: 1 (Low risk - UI styling changes only)

## Estimated Effort

Small (1-2 days)

## Notes

- Current admin.html uses fixed widths; needs flex/grid adjustments
- Ensure compatibility with existing accordion hints feature (#22)
